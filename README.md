# Water insecurity figures

1. Stacked bar chart that shows each of the 31 countries and the proportion that is both water insecure and water secure. This is a 100% stacked bar, so each column adds to 100%. 
2. Stacked bar that shows the raw numbers that are water insecure based on total population (this gets at showing the different populations, but ultimately looks yucky because the populations are so different. 
3. Made a bubble chart where each bubble is proportional to the population. Country on x-axis and proportion water insecure on y-axis. I couldn't think of another aspect to fill the bubbles in...region in the world? Although, most are Africa so that wouldn't look very interesting.
